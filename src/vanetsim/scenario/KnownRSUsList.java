 * class, an own class is used for storing the information about the RSUs. Although this means slightly
 * more overhead, it should not be a big case and allows better extensibility.<br>
 * A simple hash algorithm based on the RSU ID is used to get better performance. The hash determines the 
 * corresponding linked list(beginnings of linked lists are found in <code>head_</code>). Known RSUs with the
 * same hash are connected together through their <code>next_</code> and <code>previous_</code> values (see 
 * KnownRSU-class).
